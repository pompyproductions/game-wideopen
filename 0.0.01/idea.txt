# game idea: wide open (temporary name)

## overview

roguelike, adventurers discovering infinite dungeons

pixel art, maybe 24x24 for chibi

## how it works

!!!! ITEMS AND INVENTORY ARE RESOURCES??

	InventoryTab.tres has:
	- name (drawer, pocket...)
	- maxVolume, maxMass
	- slots (load items here)
	so you load InventoryTab.tres only if you decide that the node has an inventory!
	(no preload)

	player has pockets, backpack...
	wardrobe has left, right
	box has only box
	
	slots: minimum is 1, which is an empty slot
	when you drop something into the slots, new slot is added
	i think the slot is not even a .tres, it's a node
	
	Item(whatever item).tres has:
	- name
	- description
	- volume, mass
	- image

	so Item.gd loads all those and does something with it?
	more specific resources may inherit those 
		
	

### 00: STORY

### 01: SPLASH SCENE

menus:
new game (player name, password; like an account)
load game (click on saved game with hour and date, enter pass)
options
replay tutorial?

### 02: NEW GAME

you're playable character 1 (PC1 for short), in a handmade level where you're, exploring?

you learn to walk around in the main game mode (WSAD, jumpy pokemon-like). run into basic mobs and learn combat (with just attack and defend?).

### MOVEMENT

camera is separate from the player

player and camera are on (0,0)

when D is pressed, player travels to (1,0) with ease-out tween, and camera moves toward (2,0) but slowly

player keeps doing quick, staggered travels everytime the timer goes off (0.5s indicative), whereas camera travels ahead and more linearly

when D is released, player stops at last point, say (5,0), so the camera stays at (6,0). next time S is pressed, camera will travel from (6,0) to (5,2) and so on.





2 — BASE

this is like FFXIV character selection menu meets Necrodancer main menu

as in: you walk around as a character in your base.

ESCAPE brings up pop-up main menu, there's "save and exit", "options" etc

in the beginning it's just a desk with two characters idling around, which are your first adventurers given to you from the start. there is also a room with a bunk bed and two lockers which are your first characters' room

the lockers are your characters' equipment and inventory loadout. when they are resting they will be sleeping in their beds. you can improve the rooms (later expansion)

using the desk will bring out the character sheet (in the form of a notebook). separators on the top will take you to different menus:

ROSTER: portrait icons of unlocked characters. clicking on them takes you to the relative char log page)
LOGS: one char per page. current activity, character screen as buttons)
CURRENT ACTIVITY: character's "load page". if resting, spend time


3 — EXPLORATION

exploring: setting out from the base and exploring the map until you find a town, dungeon or whatever.

walking around in the dungeon: you explore, move through procedurally generated rooms, with various levels, and final treasure in the end. then you leave and it resets.

city: going to the smithy, tavern etc etc.


4 — INTERACTION


side-view characters. can be facing each other or not (sneaking up). 
tab will switch between MOVES (queueing defense or whatever) and ACTIONS (talking, fleeing, inventory etc)

underneath, the screen changes depending on the situation
combat: split in half for character HUDs. 

underneath, the screen is split in half for characters' HUDs, with moves on the left and actions in the middle.



 conversations, etc etc

## FUNDAMENTAL WORKINGS

### sizes and alignment

Basic unit of measurement is a **full-square**: 22x20px. A full-square is sliced in half horizontally to have a **half-square** (22x10px), which is the size of small characters and objects, roughly. Walls, terrain etc. have a tile size of full-squares. If there is no wall or full-square sized object, there can be two objects/characters in one square (upper-half and lower-half).

### map & minimap

Map generation uses full-squares as a unit. Rooms can be no smaller than 4x3 rectangle. Rooms are defined by the "empty space" inside.

Idea: step procedures. at every step, return array with rooms generated. starting room 4x3. from there, walk N/S to create two (or more) other rooms. From the rooms created (array return), pick x, and walk W/E. Every room generated shares one wall with previous room.


## ROADMAP

### 0.0 — PROOF OF CONCEPT

one character walking around in an endless cave with procedurally generated rooms
there are mobs around
you can sneak up on them or face them
facing will do a pokemon ! moment without the walking, just transition to fight scene
working fight scene: semi-realtime combat (size matters style). if sneaking up, "wide open" = special effect for every kind of attack. 
basic fight with attack and defend
you can also use buffs but they fill an "awareness" meter
there are objects with inventories, some you can push, some not
player has "moved" signal which the parent scene receives and does the turn mechanic

#### 0.0.01

Initial commit.

- basic sprites
- hand drawn map (just objects, no walls)
- player and object nodes
- player animated sprite (move)
- player and camera movement (with objects around)
- working player WASD arrows HUD
- player can move in empty spaces and cannot move in full ones

Main Scene: DemoScene

#### 0.0.02

Inventory first implementation.

Main Scene: DemoScene

#### 0.0.03

Map generation implementation.

- minimap that counts 2x2 grid squares

### 0.1 — FIRST PROTOTYPE

- procedurally generated rooms with mobs spawning in them

### 0.2 — FIRST FULL RELEASE 



### 0.3 — BASE UPDATE

different characters you can pick from your base, they all have their own adventures

very rudimentary version of game time (just counts time, is not used as currency yet)

### 0.4 — 


game time currency implemented (gacha stamina):
resting your characters takes time. you can play another character, which spends time. but if both characters are resting, you get stuck. enter "time" resource: you can speed-wait to have your cooldowns end instantly (in future, the characters travelling, learning skills also take time etc etc)

two characters for beginning. just do


0.2.1 — FIRST UPDATE

explorations added: instead of just starting in a dungeon, you go out and explore, open map with different dynamics until you find a dungeon. stuff like camping. you can find important stuff on the way?


0.2.2

there are towns and stuff, for replenishing resources (tavern, smith, market...). they are saved so you can travel between base and towns
